**Mission:** AI-powered code review tool for indie developers. Tailored for solo coders or small teams using Python, ROS2, or ML frameworks, it scans repos on GitHub for bugs, optimization suggestions, and best practices in under 60 seconds via a simple web app.

## Why It Works
Low startup cost: Build MVP with open-source LLMs like those on Hugging Face. Charge $10/month per user. Targets your niche—AI/ML hobbyists and interns facing review bottlenecks.

## Quick Launch Steps
Day 1: Set up Streamlit app with GitHub API integration.

Day 2-3: Fine-tune a lightweight model on code datasets.

Day 4: Test with your own projects, deploy on Vercel.

## Phase 1: Foundation & GitHub Integration
- [x] **Initialize Streamlit project structure** - Create `streamlit_app.py`, `requirements.txt` with Streamlit, FastAPI, PyGithub; set up virtual environment and basic app layout
- [x] **Implement GitHub OAuth authentication** - Use GitHub App or OAuth with `streamlit-authenticator`; store user tokens securely; display connected repos
- [x] **Build repo scanning engine** - Use PyGithub to clone/fetch repos, extract file trees, support Python/ROS2 (.py, .launch, .msg) and ML frameworks (.ipynb, .yaml for ML models)
- [x] **Configure GitHub API rate limiting** - Implement caching with Redis or Streamlit's session state; handle 60 req/hr limit; show progress bar during scans

## Phase 2: Model Training & Code Analysis
- [x] **Collect code review dataset** - Scrape GitHub PRs with reviews (label: bug, optimization, best practice); or use CodeReviewer dataset from Hugging Face; preprocess into (code, review) pairs
 - [x] **Select base LLM for fine-tuning** - Choose lightweight open-source model (e.g., `codellama-7b`, `microsoft/phi-2`, `bigcode/starcoder`) from Hugging Face; set up GPU (Colab/Vercel GPU) or CPU optimization
 - [x] **Fine-tune model on review generation** - Use LoRA or QLoRA for efficient tuning; train to output structured review: {severity, line_number, suggestion, explanation}; validate on held-out set
 - [ ] **Create prompt engineering templates** - Design system prompts for Python (PEP8), ROS2 (best practices), ML frameworks (overfitting, drift); store in `prompts/` directory with versioning

## Phase 3: App Integration & Deployment Prep
- [x] **Wrap model in FastAPI microservice** - Expose `/analyze` endpoint that takes code snippets, returns JSON reviews; add request timeout <5s per file; use `uvicorn` with async
- [x] **Integrate model calls into Streamlit** - Upload code files or paste snippets; call FastAPI; display reviews in collapsible UI with color-coded severity (high=yellow, medium=blue)
 - [x] **Implement result caching** - Use SQLite or Redis to cache repo hashes → review results; reduce model calls; add "re-scan" button; show cache hit rate
 - [x] **Set up Stripe subscription** - Add Stripe Checkout for $10/month; gate analysis behind subscription; add free tier: 1 repo scan/week; store user subscription status

## Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Validation
- [ ] [DEBUG-NEEDED] - [x] **Test with personal ROS2/ML projects** - Run scans on sample ROS2 nodes, PyTorch models, scikit-learn pipelines; verify detection of common issues (uninitialized variables, missing type hints)
- [ ] ] **Deploy backend on Vercel** - Deploy FastAPI as serverless function; configure environment variables (HF token, Stripe keys); set up monitoring with Vercel Analytics
- [ ] ] **Deploy Streamlit frontend on Vercel** - Containerize with Docker or use Streamlit Community Cloud; connect to live backend; add custom domain
- [ ] ] **Validate via Reddit/Indie Hackers** - Post MVP demo in r/Startup_Ideas, r/MLQuestions, Indie Hackers; collect 50 signups; iterate based on feedback; document roadmap issues
